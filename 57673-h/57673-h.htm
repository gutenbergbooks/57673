<p class="drop-cap1">‘My dear Allingham,’ he wrote, ‘it is very
charming of you to think of venturing
into this remote corner of the
world for no other reason than to
renew our friendship, and I must beg of you to
let as little time as possible elapse between your
promise and its fulfilment. Not only do I consider
your idea a delightful one, but also I venture
to find it really courageous, since to look me up again,
after so many years, must be to take something remarkably
like a leap in the dark. Well! at all events
I hope—perhaps I should say fear—that you may not
discover in me any extraordinary change. Indeed,
from this moment I throw myself entirely upon your
mercy, plead guilty to all the charges you bring
against me in your letter. It is perfectly true that
in living here the life of a hermit—a hermit, I hasten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
to add, with a taste for the philosophy of Epicurus
and Anatole France—I have not in the least fulfilled
my duties as a good citizen. Doubtless I am not
a good citizen. Doubtless, as you so kindly hint, I
ought to have married; but I suppose even <em>you</em> will
admit that it is now too late—too late for me to
think of following your excellent example. I cannot,
alas! even pretend that I want to follow it, want to
forsake my wilderness. Ah, my dear fellow, I am
incorrigible, and you need not expect to find in the
middle-aged Graham Iddesleigh an any more satisfactory
person than him you found so <em>un</em>satisfactory
at Oxford. Do you remember all that I used to be
in the old days?—unreasonable, impractical, quite a
worthless fellow! Do you ever remember the old
days at all? But of course you must, or you would
not have desired to renew them. For myself, you
know, it is the one great privilege, the one great
occupation of my life—I mean remembering. You
will scarce be pleased to learn this, I suppose;—that
is, unless you are, with increasing years, grown more
tolerant of idleness—a weakness which I confess I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
not exactly gather from your letter. But you must
forgive me for this and countless other faults. Yes—I
remember! Sometimes I remember too much!—remember,
in other words, what never really <em>was</em>;
what, alas! only might have been. You see, the
dividing line is so apt to shift a little, grow dimmer,
as the years pass.... And after all, it is only a
kind of feline habit that was born in me, and that
keeps me, like a cat, quiet in the sun, or before my
fire, dreaming, wandering in the endless woods of
Persephone. Over those woods a gentle twilight
broods, and the soft shady paths wind about, meet
and cross one another, and lose themselves again
in cool leafy distances.</p>

<p>‘Nevertheless, there have been times—moments of
dreadful egotism let me call them—when I have told
myself, as you so flatteringly tell me, that had I
been born the son of a poor man I might have
done something in the world, though exactly what,
I am as careful as you yourself are to leave undefined.
No! I’m afraid all my gifts may be reduced
to this single capacity for sitting in the sun—a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
capacity that is not of immense value to other
people, whatever pleasure it may give to myself.
I have an idea, however, that had I lived in the
days of Plato, he would have employed me to sweep
the walks of the Academe, or mow the grass, or do
something of that kind. Possibly, even to make
myself useful by illustrating the doctrine of reminiscence,
like the boy in the <cite>Meno</cite>; or I might have
taken care of the books.</p>

<p>‘This last, certainly; for I have a sneaking fondness
for the very cobwebs that gather in the corners
of a library. Last night I spent two or three delicious
hours in looking over my own volumes, taking down
one after another from the shelf, and slowly turning
their leaves. Many of them, most of them in fact—for
my tastes have not greatly changed—I had loved
in my boyhood, and these were, I confess, the ones I
lingered over longest. And, in a sense, turning their
pages again in the light of this darker-risen day was
like holding up a lamp to the past; and the soft,
gentle dust of the dead years fell all about me, floated
in the air I breathed, delicate, sweet, and sad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>‘O wondrous seed of poetry! Happy the child
into whose tender soul you have dropped at his birth!
May he keep until his death the innocence and
the heart of a boy, and may the burden of years and
the cares of the world fall lightly upon him!...’</p>
</div>

<p>He laid down his pen and turned toward the
window, while a smile, a little sad, but singularly
sweet and gentle, passed across his face.</p>

<p>After all!... Well, he supposed the years <em>had</em>
fallen lightly upon him. If he took the trouble to
look in the glass he must see that his hair was
turning grey, that his shoulders were a little stooped,
that there were lines about his mouth and eyes....
And his life?—that too, perhaps, had taken a greyish
tinge.... Monotonous?... ah yes, monotonous in
truth: but even now he had only to close his eyes
to bring up the light—the light....</p>

<p>The view of the years that opened up behind him
was in fact tranquil and pleasant enough; uneventful;
like a broad, shady garden, an old-world, sleepy
garden full of flowers still sweet and fresh. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
done little. As Allingham had pointed out (with
something of the air of a man who has made a
wonderful discovery), the years of his life had simply
floated away from him—floated away just as in
autumn dead leaves float down a river.</p>

<p>But there had been many things that had given
him pleasure. On the whole he had been happy—happy
after his fashion: and he had known, had felt,
the most beautiful thing of all, ‘the ecstasy and
sorrow of love....’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He looked out into the quiet evening. The garden
lay before him, stretching from the window in the
pale half-light. A fine misty rain had begun to fall
and was slowly shutting out the world. Presently
his gaze wandered back again to the room wherein
he sat. It rested on dark oak carvings; on the
sheen and sombreness of fine bindings; on a chipped
and broken statue of a boy, in yellowish marble;
and, lastly, on a modern portrait hanging above the
great fireplace.</p>

<p>This was the only picture in the room, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
fading light had drawn most of the colour out of it,
but his memory held up a lamp—a lamp of soft
flame—by which he beheld the full length figure of
a boy—a boy of fifteen, sixteen, slight, dark-complexioned,
with delicately oval face, and long silky
hair falling in a single great wave over his forehead.
The features were very finely moulded; the mouth
especially being quite perfect. A somewhat exotic
looking youngster, extraordinarily aristocratic one imagined,
even a little disdainful,—yes, that too, perhaps,
despite the wonderful charm of expression.</p>

<p>Harold, youngest son of Aubrey Stewart Brocklehurst,
Esquire. He remembered the name as he had
seen it in a catalogue of the Royal Academy—how
long ago? He remembered the strange conversation
he had had later on with his father, when he must
have laid bare his soul a little; he remembered the
morning when, on coming downstairs, he had found
the picture there, awaiting him.</p>

<p>Twenty—thirty years ago!—it seemed like yesterday.
Surely his father had been very good to him!
The picture, from what he had since heard of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
character of Mr. Brocklehurst, had not been bought
for nothing.... And Harold!...</p>

<p>Thus he had been when he had first met him;
thus he was now; thus he would be for ever! For
he would never grow old—he would be a boy
always. Summer would follow summer and the
fields would grow white to harvest, but Time
would thread no silver in the dusk of his dark
hair, nor dim his smile, nor make unshapely his
shapely body.</p>

<p>Graham lay back in his chair and closed his eyes.
He had already forgotten his unfinished letter to
Allingham; he had forgotten everything—everything
save the curious fantastic dream that had filled up
the first part of his life—the great light—the light
beyond....</p>

<p>How had it begun?... Had it always been?...
He tried to remember....</p>

<p>Presently he made a movement to light a cigar.
Nothing now was visible in the room save, very
faintly, the broken statue, an antique version of the
famous Spinario, which his father had come by, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
knew not how, long ago, in one of his many wanderings
through Greece. And it came suddenly into
Graham’s mind that this statue was the centre from
which everything had radiated; the touchstone around
which his whole life had revolved. <em>It</em> was the beginning,
then—the starting point. And yet—had it only
begun with his life here? Had it not been before?...
Two thousand years ago?... But the veil had descended—he
could not see.</p>

<p>This Greek boy, at all events, had been his secret
playmate throughout his childhood, the companion
who had shared his numerous adventures, the companion
of his dreams—day-dreams and sleeping-dreams.
And his mind leapt back to the dawn of his life.
He had been brought up by his father (his mother
had died in giving him birth), brought up here, in
this house; and until he had gone to school he had
had no friend of his own age. His father had himself
undertaken his education, had taught him to
read Greek at an age when most boys are stumbling
through the first page of their grammar, and before
Graham had ever heard of either Shakespeare or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Milton, he had read again and again many of the
writings of Sophocles and Plato.</p>

<p>Given such influences—his unconventional upbringing,
his ignorance of the world, his beautiful
surroundings—was it a wonder that that strange
faculty for dreaming with which he had been born
should have been perfected—perfected until in broad
daylight he would slip unconsciously from one world
to the other, and gravely tell his father of marvellous
happenings, fantastic adventures, which never could
have taken place? Yes, there had been magic influences
at work in that sleepy garden, in those broad,
soft lawns and quiet trees,—a magic, above all, in
the dim rich music of the sea.</p>

<p>For through all his childhood a subtle music had
whispered like an undersong—the music of water, the
music of running water, of sighing water—seeming to
shape his very soul, making it pliant, graceful, gentle
and pure, giving to it that gift or malady of reverie,
which was itself like the endless flowing away of a
stream. The noise of water had been ever in his
ears. At night, if he had chanced to awaken, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
heard the low sad wash of the waves; in the daytime
he had often lain for hours on the bank of a stream
that flowed among the roots of water-willows by the
foot of the apple-orchard,—lain there and let his
thoughts run on and on with the running water, so
fresh! so clear! so pure! And in the rose-garden
there was an old moss-stained fountain, a fountain
that sang in the sunshine, and wept in the twilight,
and sobbed in the night—a fountain that murmured
through the noontide to a lazy boy, whispering of
the wanderings of Odysseus, and of Jason and the
golden fleece—a fountain that curved up against the
blue and splashed back into a basin of broad green
leaves—a fountain coloured by the rainbow of romance,
and brushed by the outstretched wings of Love.</p>

<p>Sometimes in the evenings he would sit for a while
with his father on the lawn before the house, or play
a game of croquet with him; and sometimes in the
mornings he did his lessons there, or in the side-garden,
while the scent of roses, and the low booming
whisper of the bees, drifted slowly past. And whenever
he looked up he would see, stretching away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
him, trim dark walks, and soft green turf, and brilliant
flower-beds, all very still and quiet under a yellow
summer sun—he would see arches of climbing roses,
dahlias with their petals opened wide to the heat, the
sunlight itself, like a stream of daffodils, falling from
the deep blue sky. A place to dream the sleepy
hours away! a place suggestive of, leading to, that
inner contemplative life, to the boy, even then, so
precious! And looking at it now, in retrospect, he
was conscious of a drowsy calm that had hung everywhere
and over everything, hardly stirring with the
faint wind; an absolute freedom from all troublous
things, from all the tumult and discord of the world.
Attuned to such surroundings he had grown up;
on hot afternoons lying in the dark, cool, fragrant
shadow of a great beech tree that grew close to the
house—not reading, feeling rather than thinking,
letting the impression of everything about him sink
into his soul, to be afterwards an ever-present picture
there, a picture of perfect beauty, of that ideal or
spiritual beauty which, according to Plato, must lift
one’s spirit to God—willing to live and die just there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
never wandering quite so far afield even, as those dark
blue hills one could see, from the upper windows,
melting into the sky.</p>

<p>A rather sensuous boy perhaps! One, certainly,
for whom the actual colour, the physical charm of life,
of the visible world, meant much. A gentle boy
too; warm-hearted, loving and happy, innocent and
pure....</p>

<p>The visible world!—was it not almost sentient?
From the trees and the sky, from the restless sea and
the wind had emerged, at any rate, that imaginary
playmate who had made his life beautiful; the messenger
of Eros; the fair boy who had come to him
from his strange garden, his meadow of asphodel.</p>

<p>And then—he had gone to school.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">They had indeed often discussed it.
It had been perpetually there—a
source of wonder and many questions—a
thing which hovered and
danced, drew near and retreated, a
thing which could be referred to at any moment without
notice or introduction, a kind of enchanted castle
which grew up into the sky with lightning-like rapidity,
and as quickly vanished. It had not been, however,
until he was close on sixteen that the decisive step
had been actually taken, that the vision had given
place to reality.</p>

<p>His father brought him and departed again, leaving
Graham with a sinking heart in the midst of his new
world. How dreadfully different from anything he
had ever known it was all going to be! For the first
time in his life he felt thoroughly miserable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet, in a way, he was to be singularly fortunate.
Far sooner than might have been expected he dropped
into his new life. He had never, of course, played
either cricket or football, but he was naturally strong
and agile, and in the former game he now made rapid
progress. It was then that he learned how ready his
new companions were with their praise and encouragement.
If he had known more of the world, indeed,
he might have marvelled not a little at his almost
immediate popularity, for doubtless, at first, he could
not but have seemed ‘rather queer’ to the others.
Nevertheless they liked him, liked to be with him, and
if they occasionally found him alarmingly innocent—well!
somehow, it was only charming that he should
be so. To be sure he <em>was</em>, now and again, made fun
of in a way; but that way was quite the kindliest in
the world, the very opposite from the way they might
have taken had they been so minded, had their desire
been to hurt, to torment him.</p>

<p>All this, however, the fact that his new friends had
so at once and unreservedly welcomed him, had made
it so tremendously easy for him, seemed to Graham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to be merely natural, and thus, in a sense, it probably
defeated his father’s main object in sending him
to school at all; that object being, presumably, to
familiarise him with the ways of actual life. From
Graham, somehow, actual life was as far away as ever.
It was all so bright, so charming; every one was so
‘decent’ to him, so nice; how in the world was he
to know that ‘niceness’ wasn’t a thing to be counted
upon; and that he, Graham Iddesleigh, wonderfully
had been made an exception of? There seemed in fact
to be hardly a boy who was not anxious to help him,
who did not take a pleasure in watching him drop into
the ways of the place; while such things as he really
did do well—swimming, diving, running, leaping,
translating Greek—were elaborately overpraised. The
masters liked him also; and, what was more significant,
the older boys, who ignored his contemporaries,
took an interest in him, asked him to their studies,
looked after him, wanted him to do the school credit.</p>

<p>He was happy. The days passed very quickly.
Nevertheless, he had not quite learned to live the
life the others lived, and there were times when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
felt homesick. One thing in particular he noticed
(though he had made too many new friends to find
much leisure for regret), and that was just that the
old playmate of his dreams had ceased to visit him,
that he could no longer even call up very clearly
his image, remember what he was like. It was as
if the change which had come into his everyday
world had extended on into the dusky ways of
sleep, and though he did not dwell upon it at all,
yet he felt, obscurely, that something that had been
had ceased to be, and that there was a blank, a void
in his existence, which none of the many new
pleasures and interests in his life would ever be able
to fill.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">On a fallen stone, under the shelter of a
rough, loosely-piled wall, Graham sat.
All around him the landscape stretched,
field after field, bleak and bare in the
cold wintry light of a February afternoon,
while dark heavy clouds blew like puffs of
smoke across the dull grey sky. From time to time
a passing breath of wind shivered through the dry
grass, and from time to time a pale yellowish light,
like a dim reflection of some wan remote sunshine,
washed through the clouds, brightening the country
for a few moments. The boy’s chin was supported
between his hands, and he gazed out across the
monotonous fields and naked hedges, listlessly, a
little sadly, thinking of home, of the past. He felt
tired; there was a dampness, a heaviness, in the air,
which weighed upon his spirit; and something of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
his dejection was visible in the mere drooping of
his head.</p>

<p>He had passed from the golden quiet of his home
into the midst of a large public school, into a busier,
noisier world, where the real and the ideal no longer
melted into a single dreamy haze; and when he
looked back across the narrow stream of time—those
few intervening weeks!—he could not but marvel at
its depth. His former life had fallen from him like
the sinking of a picture in the fire, and he knew
that it would never come again. It was over!...
finished!... done with!... How strange!...
Yet when he closed his eyes it unrolled itself like a
broad scroll, clear in every detail.... Then, when
the voice of water, and the whisper of the wind in
the trees and in the grass had been for him almost
as the sound of human voices, and the broad open
sky and sea as the sight of human faces—then, when
such things had seemed to have the power to speak
to him directly, to speak from their own soul to
his—when Pan and his followers had been in every
thicket by the way! Ah! gazing back upon it all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
from his present position, he found time to wonder—to
wonder gravely, doubtfully—if that clear, pure
atmosphere would ever again droop its wings above
him, if things would ever be again, even for a little,
as before. Those long, peaceful summer days, and
cool, lingering evenings, when he had sat upon the
steps beside his father, watching him smoke his pipe,
and chattering to him of the different ideas and plans
that danced, or lingered in his mind, while the trees
seemed to rest so softly in the quiet air, so softly
against the sky!... A sudden wild longing for it
all, for all his old life, arose within him, and in
a passion of homesickness he flung himself down in
the swaying, sapless grass, and seemed to hear the
moaning of a sea that was breaking, miles and miles
away, upon a curved rocky shore, to hear the harsh
screams of the sea-gulls as they flew restlessly over
the grey bare waste of water, and dipped to the
tumbling waves.</p>

<p>All at once he was aroused by a foot-fall, a rustle
in the grass, and still half-blinded by his dream,
turned to face the intruder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>‘What is the matter? Can I help you at all?’</p>

<p>The words were very gently spoken, and came to
Graham with a curious familiarity and charm. But
instead of answering he sat quite still, gazing fixedly
at the stranger, his colour gradually deepening.
Fascinated, spell-bound, his lips parted, his eyes
opened wide, he hardly dared to move lest the
vision should vanish. For some moments indeed he
scarce drew his breath; for some moments it seemed
as though his whole vital force were concentrated
into one long steadfast gaze.</p>

<p>He who stood before him, nevertheless, was but a
boy of about his own age and height, though more
slightly built. For Graham, however, he was beautiful
as an angel—was, in truth, a kind of angel, a ‘son of
the morning.’ His skin—contrasting with the broad
linen collar he wore—was of that dark, olive-brown
hue which the Greeks, in their own boys, believed to
be indicative of courage; his eyes were blue and dark
and clear, his nose straight, his mouth extraordinarily
fine, delicate; his dark hair, soft and silky, falling in
a single great wave over his shapely forehead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Who are you?’ Graham faltered.</p>

<p>The boy began to blush a little—then to smile.
‘My name is Brocklehurst—Harold Brocklehurst....
Why do you look at me so strangely?’</p>

<p>His question made Graham suddenly conscious of
his rudeness, and also of the childishness, the impossibility
of the idea that had floated into his mind.
‘I did not mean to,’ he stammered, covered with
confusion. ‘I beg your pardon.’ Then, with his
eyes lowered: ‘You remind me very much of some
one I know.... It is rather queer ... and ...
and you took me by surprise.... I was so unprepared.’</p>

<p>‘Unprepared!’</p>

<p>‘Yes.... I was thinking of him—of the other—when
you came up.... You don’t understand, of
course. It is the extraordinary likeness—and it <em>is</em>
extraordinary’—he could not help looking at the
boy again.</p>

<p>‘But likeness to whom?’ Brocklehurst wondered.
‘And why should it startle you?’</p>

<p>‘Ah, to whom?’ Graham echoed enigmatically.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
His strange fancy still hung there in the air before
him, hung about his interlocutor like a light, like a
blaze of dazzling sunlight. ‘I don’t know,’ he softly
added.</p>

<p>‘You don’t know!’ Brocklehurst paused, just a
little taken aback. Then as he noticed the other’s
seriousness he began to laugh. ‘Aren’t you a rather
queer fellow?’ he suggested with a kind of charming
easiness.</p>

<p>‘We are both a little queer,’ Graham answered.
‘At least ... I beg your pardon——’</p>

<p>‘Oh, it’s all right.’</p>

<p>‘You see—you see I have known you for so long
that—that——’ His explanation, whatever it might
have been, died away.</p>

<p>‘You mean you have <em>really</em> known me. Then you
must have met me somewhere before to-day!’ He
tried to recall the occasion, but without success.</p>

<p>‘It was not here,’ Graham went on slowly, gravely.
‘I—I can’t tell you.’ He looked with a wistful,
questioning helplessness into his companion’s face.
‘If I were to tell you, should you laugh?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I don’t know. At any rate you <em>want</em> to tell me?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I want to.’</p>

<p>‘Well, fire away then.’</p>

<p>‘It is something that is rather hard for me to say....
It will make you think me so childish, so silly....
You see you couldn’t very well believe it unless—unless
you yourself were to remember, just as I do—unless
it were true——’</p>

<p>Brocklehurst glanced at him quickly. ‘Remember
having seen <em>you</em> somewhere? But I may easily have
forgotten. As a matter of fact I have forgotten—so
now.’</p>

<p>‘Yes—so now.... But I know you, for all that—the
sound of your voice even, the way you speak
and stand there.’</p>

<p>‘I only came back this morning. I do not think
you were here before Christmas.’</p>

<p>Graham shook his head. ‘It was not here,’ he
murmured. Then suddenly gathering courage, and
with his eyes half closed: ‘It was far away ... in
a garden.... Oh, I can’t tell you ... I can’t,
unless you help me.... It slips from me so quickly....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
When I try to reach it, it fades from me, though
I know it is still there ... there, somewhere’—he
smiled a little timidly. ‘Do you wonder what I
am talking about?... I am only trying to remember
a dream—a dream I have had so often.’</p>

<p>‘And <em>I</em> have something to do with it?’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes; everything’—he spoke quietly, simply.
‘You were always there, you know. It belongs to
you as much as it belongs to me. You have been
meeting me there for years!’</p>

<p>There was that in his voice which made Brocklehurst,
with exquisite tact, look carefully away from
him. ‘I don’t quite follow you,’ he said softly. ‘I
don’t think I quite know what you mean.’</p>

<p>‘My meaning is only that,’ Graham replied; ‘only
what I have just told you.’ He paused as if trying
to make it out more clearly for himself. ‘Don’t <em>you</em>
sometimes dream?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘Yes, of course.’</p>

<p>‘Well! has it never seemed to you that there must
be another world than this we are living in now?—a
world outside this, I mean, but still a real world?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>‘A dreamland?’</p>

<p>‘Call it what you like. Yes—a dreamland. But
while we are there, you know, <em>it</em> is the real world,
there is no other.’</p>

<p>Brocklehurst looked at him curiously. ‘But you
don’t believe that, do you?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I believe it—or I used to believe it. There
is something about it in the <cite>Theætetus</cite> of Plato.’</p>

<p>‘You have read Plato?’</p>

<p>‘Only a little. I used to read him with my father.’</p>

<p>‘And that is where you got your idea?’</p>

<p>‘Oh no; I have always had it. It has been like
a part of my life.... You see my dreams are rather
peculiar ... I go back in them always to the same
place—this garden—and I carry the memory of one
life with me into the other.... Do you understand
now? I can’t put it any plainer, because I am a little
confused myself. Some day it may become clearer,
and I may be able to tell you better.’</p>

<p>‘Well!—till then——’ and Brocklehurst drew himself
up on to the wall and drummed with his heels against
the stones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Till then?’</p>

<p>‘Do you talk in this way to every one?’</p>

<p>‘You mean I had better not? How should I talk
to other people, when even you do not understand
me?’</p>

<p>The other boy was silent. He was thinking. ‘What
was I like?’ he asked presently—‘in your dreams, I
mean?’ Then quickly, and before his companion could
reply, ‘No; you need not tell me.’</p>

<p>‘You do not care for me to talk to you in this
way?’ Graham questioned half sadly, and with a
strange feeling of loneliness creeping over him. ‘You
were beautiful,’ he whispered under his breath; ‘more
beautiful than any one I have ever seen.’</p>

<p>A long silence followed. If Brocklehurst were
surprised by his new friend’s last words, he at least
showed nothing. The wind stirred faintly above their
heads, and a flock of rooks flew homeward across the
grey sky. It was already getting late. The world
seemed to have floated into a clinging frosty haze,
through which a golden moon gleamed, rising slowly
up above the bare, desolate fields.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>‘We had better be going back,’ Brocklehurst said.
‘It is getting dark.’</p>

<p>They walked slowly toward the school through the
gathering dusk. To feel his companion close beside
him, and to be alone with him like this, gave Graham
an exquisite pleasure. If only he could be brave
enough to put his hand upon his shoulder! All the
way home he kept telling himself he would do so
when they reached such and such a point in the
road; but each time a curious shyness deterred him,
each time his courage failed him; and when they at
last reached the school, and his opportunity was gone,
he felt as if he had allowed something precious and
unrecoverable to slip away for ever.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Graham lay upon his back, his eyes
wide open. All around him he could
hear the silence—a silence broken
every now and again by some faint
sound from one or another of the boys who shared his
dormitory. It was more than an hour since the lights
had been put out, and all save himself were fast
asleep; but he lay awake still, thinking of the afternoon
that had just passed, and of the strange emotion
it had swept into his life. He wondered how it could
have come about, and he pondered old tales he had
read—some of them long ago—tales of a pagan world,
in which this wonderful passion of friendship, then so
common, had played its part. Returning to him now,
they wore a new and added beauty, a meaning he had
only dreamed before, but which at present filled his
mind with a kind of heavenly radiance. Might not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
his own friendship be just the same?... Might not
it, too, be something more than a mere romantic
reverie, than the shadow of a beautiful dream? He
felt an exquisite happiness in giving way to his tenderness,
in letting his imagination run on and on, like a
swift, strong river, in an ever-changing dream of love.
It was as if by merely stretching out his hand he had
touched the poetry, the soul of existence; it was as
if by stretching out his hand he had awakened another
spirit to beat its wings within his own.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Spirit of Beauty, that dost consecrate<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With thine own hues all thou dost shine upon.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So he might have sung had he known the lines. For
he felt himself raised up as on the strong, swift wings
of the morning, lifted to the very gate of Heaven.
It was on such a love as this that the Platonic philosophy
had been built; and now—now in his own life—it
had come true. Fair, and pure, and holy—down
from the garden of God—it had fallen into his soul,
had poured through the open gates of Heaven, to
bathe him in its light. He turned upon his pillow
and smiled. He stretched out his arms wide to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
great, fragrant mother-night, and she bent down over
him, cool and dark and silent, and kissed him softly
on his forehead, and on his mouth and eyes.</p>

<p>He could not sleep. A strange restlessness, a ‘spirit
in his feet,’ seemed to draw him from his bed, and
leaving his cubicle, he stood in his night-dress on the
cold floor. A flood of moonlight lay across the room,
and he watched it falling through the air, a silent,
rapid stream.</p>

<p>How still everything was! how light! Softly,
softly, on tip-toe, he made his way to the window,
and climbing on to a chair, looked out.</p>

<p>In the grounds it was light with that same cold
light, clear, yet not quite clear, earth and sky seeming
to be blended in one strange misty radiance, pale,
bluish, almost white. And the moonlight lay, still
and dreamy, everywhere, more tangible, yet more
shadowy, than the light of day. If one stretched out
one’s hands, one might almost feel it, he thought,
might almost brush it away like a great white silky
cobweb of woven flame. The stone gable of the house
stood out sharply black against the sky, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
shadows on the grass were black as ink. Above the
long row of still and leafless trees he saw the belt
of Orion, and to the right of that, the white, broken
moon faintly edged with blue. It was like the dawning
of some wonderful, icy day upon an unexplored,
a new and mysterious world; and through the cold
misty light he half expected to see the moving forms
of those who live in the unknown.</p>

<p>He did indeed see a figure—a figure coming toward
him, stepping slowly down a wide silver stair that
reached from Heaven—a figure clad in fair armour,
and with dark hair floating out against the stars....
He was calling to him from without ... he beckoned
with his hands ... he waited, waited....</p>

<p>A shudder ran through Graham’s body: he seemed no
longer to be in the dormitory, but to stand somewhere
beyond the gates of death. He clasped the bars of the
window with his hands; he leaned against the iron bars;
then he opened out his arms wide and smiled....</p>

<p>‘What are you doing?... Iddesleigh!...
Graham!’ It was Brocklehurst’s voice. His cubicle
was next the window, and he had been awakened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Nothing; nothing,’ Graham answered, startled,
turning quickly round. ‘I was looking out.... I
forgot.... Why are you not asleep?’ He went
over to his friend, and sat down by his side. Brocklehurst
had already cuddled under the clothes again.</p>

<p>‘I was asleep until you wakened me. Why are
you not in your bed?’ he whispered. ‘Why were
you standing there? What a mad thing to do at
this time of year! You might kill yourself!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I don’t take cold easily. I suppose I wasn’t
thinking of what I was doing.’</p>

<p>‘But you should have put on your dressing-gown.
You are only in your night-dress. At first I thought
you were walking in your sleep. You looked like
a white ghost there at the window. You will catch
your death of cold now if you stay there. Come in
here beside me if you want to talk.’</p>

<p>Graham got into the bed. ‘I was thinking of you,’
he said softly.</p>

<p>‘You’re a very strange fellow—aren’t you?’
Brocklehurst murmured.</p>

<p>‘Yes; I suppose so.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Hush! Speak lower. If you were caught here
with me, you know, there’d be the most frightful
row.... What were you looking at out of the
window?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know.... I seemed to see——’</p>

<p>‘What?’</p>

<p>‘I can’t tell you. I almost forget.’</p>

<p>‘You <em>must</em> tell me.’</p>

<p>‘It was a knight ... a young knight in armour.’</p>

<p>‘Out there on the grass?’</p>

<p>‘It was you.... Oh, I know there wasn’t really
anything there,’ he added hastily—‘only the light of
the moon on the ground.’</p>

<p>‘And all that you told me this afternoon—it, too,
was nothing?’</p>

<p>‘Yes—yes, it was. Some day I will tell you all
about it, from the very beginning, but not now. It
would take too long.... You see I was so much
by myself before I came here. I had no one. And—and—I
could not help speaking to you this afternoon....
You don’t understand how—how much it
is all a part of my life—how much it means to me——’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
He broke off abruptly, and for a little Brocklehurst
said nothing.</p>

<p>‘Tell me about what you used to do at home, if
you don’t mind,’ he whispered presently. Then he
lay still, listening to a rather broken and wandering
story, which very soon he grew too sleepy to follow.
‘You had better go back to your own bed now,’ he
murmured drowsily. ‘It wouldn’t do for you to drop
off asleep here. Don’t make any noise: some other
chap may be awake.’</p>

<p>Graham rose obediently, but he still lingered in the
cubicle, held by a vague yet very strong desire—desire
to unburden himself of that which filled his soul, and
which a feeling of shyness kept locked up in his breast.
Then suddenly he overcame his cowardice, and kneeling
down on the floor beside the bed, he kissed his
friend as he lay there half asleep. That was all: he
could not have spoken if he had tried to: even as
it was his eyes were wet with tears. But he felt a
kind of ecstasy of happiness as he stole back to his
own bed, for it seemed to him that just then, when
his lips had touched Harold’s cheek, he had given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
himself to him for better or worse, had given him his
life, his trust. In the morning, he knew, all would
be a little different; in the morning he should have
to come back to an everyday world. But he should be
no longer alone there; oh, he should never be alone
again. With his face buried in his pillow, and his
cheek still a little damp, he prayed that all might be
well, prayed that Harold might come to care for
him; and day was breaking when at last he fell

<p class="drop-cap">He awoke with a feeling of delightful
joyousness, a sense that something
beautiful had happened. It was as
if the summer were quite suddenly
and unexpectedly come; as if the
whole world were full of happiness and sunshine.</p>

<p>Then he remembered—remembered it all; and a
strange passionate tenderness filled his heart. Yes!
it <em>was</em> the summer—summer indeed—the sun shone
all around him. At the same time he felt within him
a deep and unaccountable shyness, which kept him
from joining his friend, which kept him alone with
his own thoughts until morning school was finished.</p>

<p>By then he had turned things over in his mind, by
then he had come even to wonder a little at his first
bewilderment. It all seemed now so natural, so only
what he had awaited, had come here for. Already a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
thing without beginning, without end! It was
simply there—there like the air he breathed—something
that had wrapped itself about his life, his whole
being. And it slid back and back, without a break,
without a pause, back into the past. There had
been no first meeting at all; he had no need even to
ask a question; there was no ambiguity to be explained,
still less an anomaly. He knew, he felt;
and as day followed day, and week followed week,
he knew and felt more and more. He listened to
the undertone, listened to it growing deeper and
more melodious, becoming at times almost articulate,
pointing the way; only when he strained his ear for
the word, the word at last, definite, decisive, it died
back again into silence.</p>

<p>And yet he had had other moments—moments
when he had seen, or had seemed to see, that
Brocklehurst understood little enough of all that
their friendship meant to him. How <em>could</em> he understand?
Graham, at least, could never tell him. Ah,
no one, no one but himself understood, no one but
himself knew how the gentle tone of his friend’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
voice had a power to draw the tears to his eyes, a
power to sink into his inmost soul. Oh, he loved
him so dearly! There was something in the very
secrecy of his affection that permitted him to keep it
passionately apart from everything else, from his life
of everyday, from any vulgar or prosaic encroachment.
He kept it in a place sacred, beautiful, quiet;
a chapel within his own spirit, a chapel into whose
soft light he passed from time to time to worship, to
be alone there, alone there with his love, alone there
before the altar he had decked with candles and
flowers, with the white stainless flowers of his boyish
admiration, his innocence and faith....</p>

<p>Nevertheless, little by little, it was forced upon
him—incredulous at first, reluctant to believe—that
Brocklehurst’s reputation was not a good one. Nothing
very precise as yet; only a few vague rumours;
but he knew, could easily see, that his friend was not
liked. At first he had found this hard to credit,
inconceivable almost; but when one boy after another
practically advised him to drop his chum he could no
longer close his eyes to the fact. Naturally he felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
tremendously angry. It seemed so mean, so cowardly,
so unfair; for no one, though all were willing enough
to hint, to suggest, appeared able to tell him anything
definite. He knew, of course, that Brocklehurst had
been absent from the school for a while—had been
removed, more than one boy quite plainly told him—but
even were this the case (and Brocklehurst himself
had never alluded to it), the fact of his having been
brought back again, in Graham’s opinion, openly,
triumphantly, established his innocence. And innocence
of what? When all was said and done, one
could be sent away for merely asserting what one
believed to be one’s rights—for impatience of routine,
a hundred things that did not in the least imply any
serious fault. It must be confessed that in his heart
of hearts he now and then wondered if assertion of
his rights, any more than impatience of routine, could
very greatly imperil a boy’s popularity; but it was
not until some time had elapsed that it actually
occurred to him that he ought, after all, to speak to
Brocklehurst himself of the matter, not telling him
of course how far public opinion was against him, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
putting him a little on his guard, giving him a little
advice.</p>

<p>It was on a Sunday afternoon when they were out
walking together—one of the latter days of spring—that
he finally made up his mind to adopt this line
of conduct; and he approached the subject at once,
though at first a little hesitatingly, and in a rather
roundabout fashion.</p>

<p>‘What are you going to be, Harold, when you
grow up,’ he asked—‘when you leave school and
college, I mean?’</p>

<p>Brocklehurst looked somewhat surprised. ‘Be!’ he
echoed. ‘Oh, I can’t tell you that. I haven’t even
thought about it yet.... Besides I don’t want to be
anything in particular. I shall be myself, I suppose—just
what I have always been.’</p>

<p>‘But I mean what shall you do?’ Graham persisted.
‘You’ll do <em>something</em>, of course. What do you think
about when you are all alone?’</p>

<p>Brocklehurst smiled. ‘Very often of you,’ he said
lightly. ‘Oh, I dare say I shall manage to drift along
somehow or other. That is what I do now, you know.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Drift?’</p>

<p>‘Yes. Don’t you think it rather charming?’ He
spoke in the half-lazy, half-ironic fashion Graham had
now grown accustomed to, but which he had noticed
to have a curiously irritating effect upon other people.
It was indeed just one of the innocent causes of
Brocklehurst’s unpopularity that he had thought of
alluding to, especially since it, more than anything
else, tended to make his masters dislike him.</p>

<p>‘I haven’t any very strong hold upon things,’
Brocklehurst amplified. ‘Everything seems nice
enough until I actually do it; but immediately afterwards
it begins to bore me a little. As soon as
you’ve tried a thing, you know, it’s apt to become
the least bit tiresome. That is why I shouldn’t care
to tie myself down to anything in particular.’</p>

<p>‘But you must, for all that, follow some definite
way of life,’ Graham answered, dissatisfied.</p>

<p>‘My dear fellow, I only want to follow you.’</p>

<p>‘Me?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, you. I’m not joking at all. Since I’ve
known you a great deal has changed. You’ve made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
me see things in a different way. It’s perhaps rather
extraordinary, but it’s true. You’re so—what shall
I call it?—good.’</p>

<p>‘But you don’t see them in <em>my</em> way,’ Graham
objected.</p>

<p>‘I know—I know. I dare say not even in a way
you’d care for. But still there is a great difference
from the old way. Only I can’t exactly tell you
what it is, nor how long it will last. Probably just
as long as our friendship. That is why I want to
keep close to you. I’ve been friends with other
boys than you, you see,—even with some of those
who try now to make you drop me. Look at those
two rows of trees, Graham, running side by side for
a little, and then suddenly branching off in opposite
directions.’</p>

<p>‘Well?’</p>

<p>‘Well: they are like our destinies.’</p>

<p>Graham glanced at him. ‘Why do you say that?’
he asked a little strangely.</p>

<p>Brocklehurst smiled. ‘That is, if our friendship is
ever to be broken,’ he explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>‘A real friendship can never be broken,’ answered
Graham slowly. ‘If you think that ours can, then it
is not a very great one—even now.’</p>

<p>Brocklehurst nodded his head. ‘I wonder what you
call a real friendship!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, if you have to ask——!’</p>

<p>‘It is only because I want you to tell me,’ he said
softly.</p>

<p>Graham smiled. Then suddenly he saw the opening
for which he had been waiting. ‘One of the
signs of a real friendship is not to be afraid to speak
openly to your friend of all that concerns both him
and you.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, that means you have something rather unpleasant
to tell me, doesn’t it?’ Brocklehurst inquired
with a not unkindly irony. ‘Friends should have no
secrets from each other, I expect?’</p>

<p>‘They ought to share everything,’ Graham replied
simply; ‘and more than anything else they ought to
share their thoughts.’</p>

<p>Brocklehurst paused. ‘Shall we sit down here,’ he
asked, with a faint sigh, ‘before we begin?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>‘You make it very hard for me,’ Graham murmured,
colouring a little.</p>

<p>‘Ah, you mustn’t mind that.’</p>

<p>They seated themselves on the trunk of a fallen
tree, and a rather awkward silence followed.</p>

<p>Below them the ground sloped down, forming a
little glen of trees and brambles, through which a
narrow stream ran. The sunlight threading its way
between the branches turned the raindrops upon the
mossy grass to tiny globes of fire; and everywhere
there was the fresh, life-giving smell of spring, of
earth and moist vegetation. Brocklehurst sat with
his chin between his hands; and his face, absolutely
immobile, might have been carved in bronze. The
corners of his mouth were drooped; and a deep line
was drawn down his forehead between his eyes; his
eyes, almost black in colour, gazed out straight before
him. He appeared to be completely oblivious to
Graham’s presence, to everything save his own
thoughts, and the latter began to wonder a little as
to what was passing in his mind.</p>

<p>And as he wondered a new world seemed to dawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
upon his consciousness—a world where good and evil
no longer stood so very far apart, were no longer so
fixedly opposed to each other, so indissoluble as they
had been, but were, rather, bound up together, inexplicably
and hopelessly, almost defying disentanglement.
A moment ago everything had been so clear,
so plain before him; now, when he looked up, the
sun was a little clouded over, and the whole colour
and meaning of life stained with a darker hue. It
seemed to him that he had been living in an atmosphere
of dreamy idealism, the fruit of a plentiful
lack of knowledge; and it did not occur to him that
his ignorance had been beautiful, springing, as it did,
not from stupidity, but from a peculiar type of mind,
and an inexperience of life, of evil, even of sorrow.
And a great compassion for the boy beside him welled
up in his heart.</p>

<p>‘Do you think I tell you everything, then?’
Brocklehurst asked suddenly, a half-mocking smile
hovering at the corners of his mouth, but in his voice
just the faintest tremor.</p>

<p>Graham kept his eyes carefully averted from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
him. ‘I think you would like to,’ he answered
slowly.</p>

<p>Brocklehurst shook his head. ‘No; I shouldn’t
like to.’</p>

<p>‘Well then, you—you can’t trust me very much.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, but I do trust you.... Why do you want
to be so serious?’ He smiled faintly. ‘I notice that
you keep all your seriousness for me, who am nevertheless
supposed to be your chum.’</p>

<p>Graham looked doubtfully at him. ‘Tell me that
everything is all right,’ he said, ‘and I will believe
you.’</p>

<p>‘Everything is all right.’</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>‘Do you think you are keeping your promise?’
Brocklehurst asked, with a little laugh.</p>

<p>‘No; I suppose not.’</p>

<p>‘What do you want to hear? What do you want
me to tell you? It is foolish, isn’t it, to bother about
what is horrid, when there is so much that isn’t?’</p>

<p>‘In you, do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘In me, if you like.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Graham turned away while he tried to puzzle it out.
Then once more facing his companion, he seemed to
himself to risk everything in a single question: ‘Why
were you sent home?’</p>

<p>Brocklehurst just perceptibly coloured. ‘You haven’t,
you know, considering that you are my friend, a very
overwhelming confidence in me.’</p>

<p>Graham looked down. ‘Yes, I have,’ he answered
suddenly, impulsively. ‘You must forgive me. I am
a pretty low kind of chap to have ever doubted you;
but I’ll never do so again.’</p>

<p>‘Not even if another fellow comes along and tells
you things?’</p>

<p>‘Never, so long as I live.... What a beast you
must think me.’</p>

<p>Brocklehurst shook his head. ‘I only think that
some one has been doing his best to turn you against
me. I dare say it is natural enough.... You see,
I used to get out at night—not very often, but now
and again—and they didn’t understand.’</p>

<p>‘Get out?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; through one of the windows.... And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
because I didn’t take anybody into my confidence,
they were sure I was up to no good.... I <em>had</em> to
go.... I can’t explain.’</p>

<p>‘You mean, it <em>wasn’t</em> to do any harm?’</p>

<p>‘It was only to be out there—to breathe the air, to
be under the sky.’</p>

<p>‘But in the daytime—couldn’t you——’</p>

<p>‘No. I wanted to run in the moonlight; to run
over the meadows; to bathe in the river; to be free.’</p>

<p>‘But why didn’t you tell them—when you knew
what they thought?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, they are welcome to their thoughts. I’ve
never in my life explained any of my actions, and
I’m not going to begin now. Do you know——?’
he hesitated.</p>

<p>‘Know what?’</p>

<p>‘Only a strange fancy I used to have at such
moments. It was rather queer’—he smiled shyly.
‘I used to feel just as if I had gone back to the life
I had always been accustomed to—as if I had just
awakened, if you can understand—while the other,
my ordinary life, appeared to be a kind of dull dream,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
a kind of captivity which I should have to return to,
but which, nevertheless, was not real.’</p>

<p>Graham watched him a moment in silence. ‘Suppose—suppose
your fancy were the truth!’</p>

<p>‘The truth! Oh, nonsense! How could it be?’</p>

<p>‘Suppose you really did, long ago, live a life like
that!’</p>

<p>‘Among woods and meadows and streams?’</p>

<p>‘Long ago, long ago——’</p>

<p>Brocklehurst shook his head.</p>

<p>‘The grass was soft under your feet,’ Graham
whispered dreamily, ‘and there was the humming of
bees——’</p>

<p>‘Where?—Where do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘And you played on the flute of Pan; and you
bathed in the streams.... Do you remember?’</p>

<p>‘It was there that we first met?’</p>

<p>‘It was there that we ran in the sunlight over the
green grass.’</p>

<p>‘It was there that we lay in the shadow of the
trees.’</p>

<p>‘The deep sea: the dark sky: the sunshine: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
waving branches: the garden:—it is just as if I could
see the reflection of them all in your eyes.... <em>Do</em>
you remember?’</p>

<p>Brocklehurst shook his head again. ‘Only when
you tell me,’—he laughed somewhat ruefully. ‘After
all, it is <em>your</em> garden, you know. I can’t get there
by myself.’</p>

<p>‘If we really could get there!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, well, I’ll come with you any time if you’ll
show me the way.’</p>

<p>‘Suppose you had a dream,’ Graham said slowly,
thoughtfully, ‘and in your dream you saw there was
only <em>one</em> way—should you have the courage to take
it? I mean, if it was a way that seemed to lead
into the darkness?—death!’</p>

<p>‘Death!’ Brocklehurst looked at him as he repeated
the word. ‘No,’ he half whispered, ‘not that—I
hate the idea of it. I hate everything connected
with it.’</p>

<p>‘Still——’</p>

<p>‘Have you ever seen a dead person?’</p>

<p>‘No.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I have, then—once.... I was made to look....
It was my grandfather.... But I’ll never look again
at anything of that kind—never—never—never....
He was so changed—you can’t think.... His face
and hands were like wax.... His hands.... Oh,
I didn’t like them.... I saw them that night after
I had gone to bed ... they were on the bedclothes ...
they came closer and closer ... it was horrible....
No, no, there was no garden for him, believe
me!—nothing—nothing any more.’</p>

<p class="drop-cap">And it seemed to Graham that nowhere,
save only in a few poems,
and in one or two passages of Plato,
he could find the expression of a
sentiment even approximating to
that he felt for his friend. Many books he turned
over, and such lines as caught his fancy he read
again and again until he knew them by heart. Those
portions of the <cite>Sonnets</cite> of Shakespeare which were
least rhetorical, which appeared to spring from a
genuine feeling, he learned in this way. Was not
<em>his</em> friend, too, the ‘lord of his love,’ the ‘herald
of the spring,’ the ‘lovely boy,’ the ‘rose of beauty,’
‘music to hear’?—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘For all that beauty that doth cover thee<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Is but the seemly raiment of my heart.’<br /></span>

<span class="i0">‘Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Nevertheless, it was in two poems by Rossetti,
two poems of unsurpassable beauty, <cite>The Stream’s
Secret</cite> and <cite>Love’s Nocturn</cite>, that he found, or thought
he found, what he himself actually felt; their suggestion
of a kind of impassioned mysticism appealing
to him, being indeed but an echo of that curious
vein of mysticism which from the first had entered
into and made more wonderful his own love. These
poems, altering the gender of the personal pronouns,
and thinking of Harold while he said them, he
repeated over and over to himself, until in the
end they became in his mind so bound up with his
friend that he could not have imagined them in any
other connection, that he could not have heard them
without seeing Harold’s face.</p>

<p>The spring passed quickly; summer was already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
here; and as Graham, fallen now completely into the
ways of his new life, watched one day after another
glide swiftly from him, sometimes he longed to stretch
out his hand to stay this or that particular hour and
keep it with him for ever.</p>

<p>On an afternoon in the beginning of July he had
flung himself down in the shade, and was lying on
his back among the long, sweet-smelling grass. He
had been fielding out for more than an hour under
a deep, cloudless sky, and he was a little tired and
hot. His straw hat lay on the ground beside him,
and he gazed up at the sky through the leafy branches
of a tree that stretched above him like a gigantic
parasol. The delicious summer heat, the stillness,
made him feel rather drowsy; and he let his thoughts
wander hither and thither on the wings of every idle
fancy. Already the shouts from the cricketers reached
him only as a far-off murmur, blended dreamily in his
mind with the humming of a great black and yellow
striped bee, which flitted noisily from cup to cup of a
group of purple fox-gloves growing close at hand.</p>

<p>Days like this were very beautiful, he thought, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
this old volcanic earth with its bright delicate covering,
like a carpet, of grass and trees and flowers. And
life!—yes; and life itself was beautiful! For the
same life that was moving joyously within his young
warm blood, was moving in the sap of tree and
grass. What was it all? Whence did it spring?
Every day a miracle was wrought when some delicate
leaf, or the spiral of a new-born fern, unfolded itself
in the soft air, or pushed up through the dark clinging
soil. And this was life! And he was alive! He
found an exquisite happiness in the thought that he
himself was thus a part of nature, so close to nature
in her simpler forms. It was as if—always alive to
the charm of such things—he understood now for the
first time the full meaning of the old Greek ‘tree-worship,’
realised, as it were, its origin, in his own
emotions. That faculty for noting the listening soul,
the spirit that is in leaf or plant, seemed to be a part
of his very human nature, seemed as some ancient
bond of relationship that bound him then, and would
bind him for ever, to stiller and less perfect forms of
life—to a whole world of pastoral divinities—the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
god Pan himself; the Hamadryads, who inhabit the
forest trees; and Oreads, and Naiads, and Hyades—the
deities of water-springs, and streams, and showers
of summer rain.</p>

<p>As he thought of it a wave of joy seemed to raise
him up suddenly on its strong, full flood; a deep
happiness that had come to him often before in his
solitude, and which, for the time at any rate, was
sufficient. To live! to live! to live! it seemed to
cry—that was enough; there was nothing else in the
world. Ah, surely he must be happy so long as the
sun shone and all nature sang with that great
rhythmic chaunt of sensuous life! He closed his
eyes that the exquisitely fresh and living smell of the
earth, his mother, the cool sweet green smell of the
swaying grass, might creep into his very being. How
delicious it was just to lie there in the lush green
grass, among the clear, floating shadows—to lie and
think his thoughts as they drifted into his mind from
the outer sunshine.</p>

<p>When he chose to look in their direction, he could
see his schoolfellows eager still over their game of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
cricket; but he was content to watch them, content
to look on, lazily, dreamily, through his half-closed
eyelids, following every now and then the swift
curving passage of the ball through the air, when it
rose above the fielders’ heads.</p>

<p>And in everything, though in a somewhat misty
fashion, he seemed to feel the personality, the influence,
of Harold Brocklehurst. Was it not all—his extraordinarily
vivid sense of life—bound up in some subtle
way with the beauty of their friendship? Had not
their friendship helped him to realise the mystery and
loveliness of nature; helped him to make things out;
helped to unseal his eyes? It was the force of a
temperament that found expression very easily, which
he felt to be working now upon his own simpler
nature, his spirit, his mind,—altering everything
around him, awakening a new beauty in familiar
things, suggesting a wider, deeper, more mystical
beauty where before he had only been conscious of a
material impression. It carried with it, too, a hundred
hints, memories, of a strangely familiar paganism, of
a fresher, younger world; a hundred touches of poetry:—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
sun, the climbing plant: Apollo, Dionysus:—strong,
beautiful, swift. This boy!—what had he to
do with them? Why should he suggest them? And
then, in the background, a haunting sense of something
darker, more fateful—tragic even!—again the
legend of Dionysus; but more pitiable, quite human,
vaguely pathetic and bewildering.</p>

<p>By and by he opened a copy of the <cite>Phaedrus</cite>, which
he had worked through with his father, and began to
read.</p>

<p>They had studied together most of the shorter
dialogues, and the whole of the <cite>Republic</cite>, but the
<cite>Phaedrus</cite> Graham cared for most. In its pages he
had taken his first peep at philosophy—philosophy, as
conceived by him, so near to, so replete with, poetry;—‘Really,
Phaedrus, you make a most charming guide.’
Nay, it <em>was</em> poetry! deep, impassioned poetry! for
with Plato, even the trees and streams, all the lovely
things of the visible world, were made to play their
parts. It was as if they possessed active and living
souls. They had at least, the boy felt, a wonderful
share in the development of one’s <em>own</em> soul: they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
seemed to breathe about it an atmosphere of light and
purity and happiness. In Plato’s philosophy—so far
as he understood it—there was little he could not accept.
On one very hot, still day, for instance, a passing
breath of wind on his face had suddenly awakened in
him the recollection of a prior existence—faintly,
vaguely, perhaps, but still quite clearly enough to
stamp a definite impression on his mind.</p>

<p>And for him, of all writers, this old Greek had the
most delightfully personal charm. As he read him,
indeed, it seemed as if the peculiar beauty of his
nature were exhaled gently from the printed pages—gently
and very delicately—like, say, the faint perfume
of a spray of sweet-briar he had dried a few
days ago between them, and which now as he came
suddenly upon it and held it to his lips, breathed still
the ghostly shadow of its former fragrance. Surely
no other books were so fair and sweet, so wise and
true. In the charmed circle of their range, the
coarser qualities of things were forgotten, the light
was cleansed, the whole realm of the soul lay clear.
He knew no other writings that flowed in with so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
gracious a charm upon one’s spirit, filling it with a
love for all that is beautiful and good, watering its
‘wing-feathers’: no others that exercised so humanising
an influence upon one’s character. For it was, in
truth, before all else, a philosophy of life, of the
highest life one may hope to lead here upon earth, or
later on in heaven. A philosophy of love, too, necessarily!—and
of beauty. Of all earthly things beauty
approximated most nearly to its eternal idea: and love!—well,
all desire for good and happiness, nay, even
the working of philosophy itself—all that was only
the gracious power of love. On these the path was
builded, the Platonic ladder reaching from earth to
heaven; for one climbed, after all, to those pure,
colourless regions, to that radiant world of ideas, by
Phaedo’s golden hair.</p>

<p>Well! such a doctrine met most of the needs of
his own spirit, and awakened in him, naturally, a very
friendly feeling for its author; the kind of affection
we have for any one who has thought just the same
thought, felt just the same joy or sorrow, that we are
thinking and feeling now. As a young boy will linger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
long beside some deep pool of sea-water he finds
among the rocks, peering down into its minute caverns
and among its seaweeds for unknown curiosities and
treasures, so Graham lingered over these pages, trying
to learn all things from them, a rule of life for himself,
a rule whereby he might, as far as was possible, enter
into and judge the lives of others, might discover
what to cling to, what to throw away. Over the dark
still well of Life he leaned, and through that deep
cool water, ruffled gently by the soft warm breath of
youth, the face of Love himself arose, his hair streaming
back like a flame, his sad grey eyes full of an
infinite pity.</p>

<p>And he began to dream of an immortal love which,
though unable to realise itself perfectly in this world,
yet might be strong enough to draw two souls together,
after death, in some far heaven. Far! But
in truth it seemed quite near just now:—was here, a
soft radiance, in his own spirit, in the warm air that
blew about his face, in the sunlight, in the trees, in
the voices of his playmates. Only afterwards—afterwards
there would be that untroubled and perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
communion which hovered now before him as an unattainable
ideal, a light behind the clouds, a flame on
the horizon; ‘for then, and not till then, the soul will
be parted from the body and exist in herself alone.’</p>

<p>Plato’s theories blew just like a cool wind upon
the dust gathered in one’s mind. They entered one’s
mind easily and at once, sinking down into the very
depths of one’s spirit, to be a light there for ever, to
sing there for ever, as the morning stars sang together.</p>

<p>And they were so bound up with ordinary existence,
with the affairs of every day! They stretched out
from their idealism a friendly hand to which he could
cling when struggling along the rough muddy roads
of the world. But above all, he was charmed with
the theory of natural suggestion, the influence beautiful
things have upon one in childhood and boyhood in
the building-up and equipment of one’s character.
The grouping of clouds about a sunset, the noise of
running water—these, and other things like these, were
working always, working delicately, upon one’s mind
and temper, shading them, as it were, to fairer colours
and softer outlines. For material beauty is at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
one rung, though it be the lowest, in the Platonic
ladder. Higher fair souls; fair virtues higher still;
and highest of all the pure idea of Beauty itself,
invisible to the eye of sense, but lying bright and clear
before the vision of the mind, a glorious sight, to be
viewed by those alone who have cleansed their souls
of earthly passions:—‘Blessed are the pure in heart,
for they shall see God.’</p>

<p>When he had finished the little introduction he
closed the book and laid it upon the grass beside him.
Nothing he had ever read, he thought, called up more
vividly the impression, the very sound and smell of life
out of doors. In each word was an exquisite suggestion
of nature, of the open air, of the trees and green
grass, and the cool shallow stream up which Socrates
and Phaedrus had walked. The spirits that had
haunted the bank under the plane-tree seemed now to
haunt the pages of the dialogue. And indeed, as
though magically changed, the elm above him had
suddenly become a plane-tree. Nay! he could hear,
actually hear, the trickle of the stream—could hear the
chirping of the grasshoppers. And Phaedrus and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Socrates!—yes, Phaedrus and Socrates were talking
still: if he listened very intently he could make out
the tones of their voices, even their words—if he closed
his eyes he could see them.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Beloved Pan, and all ye other gods who haunt this
place, give me beauty in the inward soul; and may
the outward and inward man be at one. May I reckon
the wise to be the wealthy, and may I have such a
quantity of gold as a temperate man and he only can
bear and carry.—Phaedrus, need we anything more?
The prayer I think is enough for me....’</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The sounds about him drew farther and farther away
as though fading back into dreamland. A clear light,
pale green, like a reflection from some deep pool, was
in the sky. The whole world was changed, and he
seemed to be wandering in a country of gentle streams
and meadows, while the green grass was gay with
yellow daffodils.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The sunlight slanted lower, falling on the upper
windows of the school. Was his dream less real than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
that soft light, he wondered? Did not both come
from somewhere in the clouds? It explained so much;
it pushed back, as it were, the horizon. Plato had
believed in it. Could it be, then, that there were
certain persons—like Plato, like himself—who were
actually nearer to the unseen than others were?
Surely things came to him, with the scent of flowers,
with the sighing of wind, with the splash of the sea!
There was a spirit which breathed upon him from the
rustling trees and from the grass under his feet.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">When the summer holidays came round
he brought his companion home with
him. Hot and dusty after their
journey and the long drive from the
station, they were glad enough to
catch a glimpse of the house when yet some distance
away. And as the evening sun, washing the beeches
with soft red-gold, fell obliquely on the upper windows,
the effect for the young visitor was one of a
singularly peaceful beauty, such as he had never before
known. Standing back among the trees in the midst
of that green terraced garden—a house of stillness
and of charm—to him it appeared to be, as indeed it
was, cut off completely from the outer world—the
world, at least, as it had been for him; a London life,
a hurried, anyhow existence when he joined his people
in the holidays.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>For Graham, also, to be home here once more was
very pleasant. They dined in the great oak dining-room—the
light of sunset streaming in across the table,
catching the whiteness of damask, the deep crimson
of roses half buried in their dark green leaves, the
gleam of glass and old silver, and making the shaded
candles to be but ornamental. On the dark panelled
walls hung a few choice Dutch ‘genre’ paintings:—an
‘Interior,’ by Pieter de Hooch; a ‘Music Lesson,’
by Gerard Terburg; a ‘Frost Scene,’ by Adriaen
van de Velde; a ‘Portrait,’ by Gerard Dou; but no
picture, Graham thought, could ever be half so
charming as the young boy sitting opposite him,
the softly blended light playing upon his beautiful
face, his delicate hands. Graham watched him with
a curious feeling of pride. He noticed his delightful
courteousness, his perfect breeding, his wonderful
distinction. Yes, there was a great deal in birth, in
blood! For even in his short experience of school
life he had learned something of the hopelessness
and vulgarity of a spreading democracy. And he saw
with pleasure that his father had taken to the boy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
that he was not insensible to the deference of Harold’s
manner, his efforts to please, his easy grace.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After dinner the two boys wandered out of doors
again, but went no further than the porch. Both
were a little tired. Brocklehurst sat on one of the
steps, and Graham half sat, half lay, a little below
him, tracing with the point of a stick fantastic
lines and figures in the gravel of the carriage sweep.
The quiet of evening, of the perfect ending of a day,
was all about them; and they sat in silence, that
strange silence which seems to listen for the faint
footfall of the hour that is approaching, the hour
that is to be, the hour as yet so full of mystery, of
hope, of the unknown.</p>

<p>The lawn stretched below them, smooth, greyish
in the waning light. Upon its shaven surface clumps
of laurel, barbary, and rhododendron stood out as
darker, bordering patches—stood out a little stiffly in
the nearly windless air; and against the clear pale
sky the trees of the avenue were still.</p>

<p>‘How close that cloud is!’ Graham murmured.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
‘Isn’t it almost as if we ourselves were floating up
to it?’</p>

<p>Yet notwithstanding the dreaminess of his mood,
his senses were curiously alert. Remote sounds and
faint perfumes reached him, which at another hour
he would not have been conscious of. And he
noticed Brocklehurst’s hands as they rested on the
stone step: he noticed the fineness of the skin,
darkened to a rich golden-brown by the sun; the
tapering fingers; the tiny blue vein, scarce visible,
on the inside of the wrist. His hands were extraordinarily
living, extraordinarily sensitive, expressive.
They seemed made to touch the strings of musical
instruments, to play upon some delicate lute or viol.
He imagined that they must have some power in
them to allay pain; he imagined them, cool and
soothing, laid softly upon his own forehead, or over
his mouth and eyes.</p>

<p>And suddenly Harold began to speak. ‘It is very
quiet here.... How strange you must have found
everything when you first came to school!—after
having been accustomed to this for so long.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Graham smiled lazily. He felt very happy. It
was as though a day he had long awaited had at
last begun to break within his spirit, as though some
perfect hour of life were here. And his present
gladness was mingled somehow with all the happiness
that had been before; with all the happiness he
had ever known. He watched the dark leaves scarce
tremulous against the sky; he watched the dark grass,
the gathering dusk everywhere; the night wind was
soft upon his face.</p>

<p>The light grew more and more subdued; the outlines
of things vaguer and vaguer.</p>

<p>‘I cannot tell you how glad I am to have you
here, Harold,’ he whispered shyly.</p>

<p>‘It was very good of your father to ask me.’</p>

<p>‘To ask you! But it all belongs to you! It has
all been waiting for you for so long—and now, at
last, you have come.’ He spoke half-laughingly, but
all his childish imaginings and dreams were stirring
within him.</p>

<p>‘How dark it is getting!’</p>

<p>The last glimmer of twilight had in truth died out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
of the sky, and only a dim pallor seemed to hang in
the air, a faint reflection from the hidden moon.</p>

<p>‘Listen!’</p>

<p>‘It is my father. He plays to himself every
evening; he is very fond of music.’</p>

<p>The soft, clear notes of a violin were drawn out
slowly across the stillness. The darkness, the charm
of the night, helped to make them wonderfully expressive,
and Brocklehurst almost held his breath to
listen. When a pause came he gave a little sigh.
‘Why is beautiful music always so sad?’ he wondered;
‘so much sadder than anything else?’</p>

<p>‘Is it?’ Graham asked. ‘And yet you like it!’</p>

<p>‘Yes; there is nothing else I like so well.... I
used to sing in the choir at school until my voice
broke; but I have never learned very much.’</p>

<p>Graham raised himself a little. He leaned his
chin on his companion’s shoulder and looked out
into the darkness. And he felt Brocklehurst’s soft,
warm cheek against his own.</p>

<p>‘You went to school when you were very young,
Harold, didn’t you?’ he murmured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>‘No younger than most fellows. You, you know,
came peculiarly late.’</p>

<p>‘My father liked to have me here ... I have not
been at school a year yet ... but all those other
years before I went seem very far away. I can look
back at the past as if it had only been a single hour.
Everything slips together into one golden point....
I wonder if, when a man is dying, it is like that—if,
when he looks back, all his life gathers together
into one long, long day—if all seems but a summer
day—yesterday between sunrise and sunset——’</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Gradually, as he rowed, the familiar
landmarks grew smaller and the scene
widened out, while the sprinkling of
little cottages slid closer together.
Beyond these, the spire of the church rose like a
slender thread into the dark blue sky.</p>

<p>Brocklehurst’s eyes rested upon his face, but he
appeared to be quite unconscious of this, his own dark
grey eyes fixed on some point in the remote.</p>

<p>At length he drew in his oars.</p>

<p>How far away the land seemed! All around, sea—sea
unspotted by a single sail—sea stretching from
world to world.</p>

<p>He lay back in the bow of the boat, and for a time
appeared to have fallen into one of those reveries his
companion knew so well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>And Brocklehurst began to murmur to himself while
he dabbled his hand in the water.</p>

<p>‘What?—What do you say?’ At the sound of
his friend’s voice breaking through the fine meshes of
his dream, Graham roused himself and made a movement
to sit up.</p>

<p>Brocklehurst smiled. ‘Nothing—nothing. I was
only talking to myself.’</p>

<p>Graham looked at him. ‘Doesn’t it seem as if we
were quite out of the world here, Harold? We shall
never be more alone together than we are now. I
can hardly remember when we came.... Do you
think we shall ever go back?’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps the sea round Ireland is haunted, like the
sea of the Ancient Mariner.’</p>

<p>‘And the sea across which Odysseus sailed. Surely
almost every place is haunted by this time. If we
rowed on a little further we might come to Circé’s
Island, or to the land of the Lotus-eaters, or to the
home of Nausicaa.’</p>

<p>And even while he spoke they seemed to drift into
a stiller air—or was it his fancy? His thoughts seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to be borne into his mind from somewhere far away,
and the faint lapping of the water against the boat
recalled to him his dream.</p>

<p>‘Last night I went back there, Harold—I found
the old way.... Shall I tell you?... You remember
the curious dream that filled up so much of
my life here.... I think it must be beginning to
open out again.’</p>

<p>‘You mean about the boy whom you used to fancy
as being in some way connected with me?’</p>

<p>Graham met his eyes. ‘Are you quite sure he
wasn’t?’ he asked softly. ‘You must tell me, because
just now, somehow, I am not quite certain
myself.’</p>

<p>‘What has changed you, then? You used, you
know, to be sufficiently sure.... Do you remember
the day I found you out in the fields?’</p>

<p>‘The day you came to me?... You came when
I called.’</p>

<p>‘Well, you were very certain then, weren’t you?’
He laughed a little at the other boy’s gravity.</p>

<p>‘That was the beginning,’ Graham murmured. ‘Do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
you know that from that day until last night I have
never dreamed of you, nor of the place where I used
to find you ... never till last night.’</p>

<p>‘And last night you <em>did</em>?’</p>

<p>Graham glanced up at his companion. ‘It all came
back,’ he answered simply. ‘You were there—just
as before I went to school—but changed—a little
changed.’ He tried to remember. ‘I can’t exactly
say what the difference was,’ he went on slowly,
turning it over in his mind. Then he paused, in his
effort to puzzle it out? ‘<em>Why</em> should you have come
back?—after so long, I mean. Why, if you <em>were</em>
coming, should you not have come sooner?’</p>

<p>‘Ah, I can’t tell you,’ smiled Brocklehurst. ‘Perhaps
if you had asked me last night——!’</p>

<p>‘You would have told me?... You did tell me,
but I don’t remember what you said. Somehow it
has all grown very dim. Your being with me here,
I think, has thrown the other back.’</p>

<p>‘But wasn’t it to tell you something that I returned?’</p>

<p>A peculiar, half-baffled expression passed across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Graham’s face. ‘I thought I was going to remember,’
he sighed, ‘but it has gone again.... I suppose I
shall never know now.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, well, I can’t help you any further.’ Brocklehurst
watched him with some amusement.</p>

<p>‘No.’ He sighed again. Then he looked across
once more at his companion. ‘As soon as I fell
asleep I saw him—my dream-boy. I awoke, it
seemed, on the sea-shore, at the very gate of his garden.
And I heard his voice calling me—calling, calling....
Oh, I remembered his voice so well! I opened the
gate, and he was there.’</p>

<p>He paused a moment, and his eyes grew dark with
a strange shadow. And it was through this shadow
that his next words seemed to drop, his voice becoming
lower and lower, till at length it was scarce audible,
scarce more than a whisper.</p>

<p>‘Who he is, what he is; if he indeed be your spirit,
or if you only remind me of him, I suppose I shall
never know. At times I think he must have been
born with me, and have grown with the growth of
my soul. Until I went to school, at any rate, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
have already told you, he was my only playmate.
When I was a little boy I used to pretend he was
in the garden with me, and I used to look for him
here and there, just as if he were hiding from me in
some game.... At night, I remember, when I had got
into bed I used to wonder where he was just then,
and if he would be waiting for me when I woke up
in his country. And he always <em>was</em> waiting—standing
there patiently, smiling, ready to welcome me....
Now and then I even went to bed earlier than usual,
to see if I could by any chance get there before
him; but I never could, because, I suppose, he lived
there....</p>

<p>‘And last night—I don’t know why—it was just the
same. Everything happened as in the old days....
It is rather strange, for of late it had all grown a little
dim and far away—faint, unreal even, when I tried
to bring it back.... And I remember he took me
to the edge of a pool, and when I looked into the
water I saw reflected there my own room—a boy
lying asleep in the bed—myself——’</p>

<p>He paused, smiling faintly, his whole face filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
with the light of his memory. Brocklehurst watched
him curiously.</p>

<p>‘Sometimes,’ he went on, ‘sometimes the wind,
when it is not too loud, seems to bring back the
sound of his voice ... and his voice is just like
yours, Harold.... Once, at school, I remember, I
was sitting before the fire, half asleep and half awake,
when suddenly he seemed to come very close to me,
to be in the room, to be leaning over the back of my
chair. Then I shut my eyes and I felt his soft hair
brush against my cheek—and I waited—and oh, I felt
so happy.... All at once the door opened and you
came in.... And you leaned over my chair just as
he had done, while you talked to me.’</p>

<p>‘You are making me feel very jealous,’ said Brocklehurst
with pretended seriousness. ‘I expect you like
him much better than you like me!’</p>

<p>‘There is no difference ... except——’ He
stopped short while Brocklehurst began to laugh.</p>

<p>‘Well, what were you going to say?’</p>

<p>Graham coloured a little. ‘Let us change places.
You can row back.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Brocklehurst obeyed him, but he still kept his eyes
fixed on Graham’s face. ‘What is the difference?’
he persisted. ‘What were you going to tell me?’</p>

<p>‘Nothing—nothing,’ Graham answered almost confusedly.
‘It is just in his—his manner.’</p>

<p>‘That means, I suppose, that he <em>is</em> nicer—after all!’</p>

<p>‘No, it doesn’t mean anything of the kind.’</p>

<p>‘Well, it must mean something, you know. And
if not that, why are you afraid to tell me?’</p>

<p>‘I’m not afraid to tell you.... It means just that
he likes—me.’ He gazed down through the water.</p>

<p>Brocklehurst regarded him a little strangely. For
a moment he seemed about to speak, but in the end,
without saying anything, he dipped his oars and
began to row back.</p>

<p>A long silence followed.</p>

<p>‘Where shall we go now?’ Brocklehurst asked
gently. The boat was heading for the cliffs, which
rose, dark and naked, out of the clear water.</p>

<p>‘There is a place a little to the left where I think
we can land if you would care to bathe.’</p>

<p>Brocklehurst brought the boat round to the desired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
spot, and they scrambled out on to a broad flat shelf
of rock where, having made fast the rope, they sat
for a while dangling their feet over the edge.</p>

<p>The sunlight made the water very clear and
tempting. Floating faintly through the still afternoon
came the notes of the church clock. From
everywhere the salt, invigorating smell of seaweed
just uncovered by the ebb tide was blown into their
faces, and long trailing branches of it, golden-brown
and grass-green in the sunlight, rose and sank with
the swell. Here and there, a little lower down,
sprays of a brighter colour were visible—pink and red
and orange, like delicate, feathery coral.</p>

<p>‘This place and this weather are pleasant enough
for Pan,’ Graham murmured. ‘Next month it will
be all over, and we shall be going back to school.
I wonder if it will ever be just so nice again.’</p>

<p>After their bathe they sat on the rocks, baking in
the hot sun. ‘How brown your hands and face and
neck are!’ said Graham lazily. ‘The rest of you
seems so white.... I wonder if the Greeks ever
made a statue of a diver? I don’t remember one.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Then a sudden thought seemed to strike him and
he sprang to his feet, his drowsiness suddenly gone.
‘Wait a moment,’ he cried. ‘Stand there.... Turn
round just a little.... You must lean against the
rock and hold this bit of seaweed in your hand;
and you must cross your feet—like that. Oh! if
you just had pointed ears, or the least little bit of
a tail!... A Faun! A Faun! A young woodland
Faun!... You are far nicer than the statue.’
And a look almost of wonder came into Graham’s
face.</p>

<p>Next, making him sit down, he put him in the
posture of the ‘Spinario,’ his old favourite; and
then, raising him to his feet once more, he made
him stand like the praying boy of the Berlin Museum,
the ‘Adorante,’ his face and hands uplifted to the
joy of the morning.</p>

<p>‘And now what else?’ he murmured. ‘You are
too young for an athlete. Your body is too slender.
I will make you into a youthful Dionysus instead.
Let me put this seaweed in your hair. It is a
wreath of vine.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>He placed him so that he leaned against the black,
smooth rock, and the soft melting lines of the boy’s
body shone out with an extraordinary beauty from
the sombre background. Graham paused for a
moment, and stepping back, shaded his eyes with
his hand while he gazed fixedly at his work.
A faint colour came into his cheeks and he advanced
again. Very gently he pulled the brown
waving hair over the boy’s forehead, and a little
lower still, giving to his face a more feminine oval,
like that of Leonardo’s ‘Bacchus.’ He pulled his
head, too, slightly forward, bending it from the
shapely neck; and with delicate fingers he half
lowered the lids of the dark, clear blue eyes, till the
upper lashes, long and curling, cast a shadow on the
cheek below; and he parted the lips, ever so softly,
till a strange dreamy smile seemed to play upon them.</p>

<p>The accuracy of his touch almost startled him, and
his colour deepened as the boy’s beauty flowed in
upon him, filling him with a curious pleasure. He
laughed aloud. ‘You are just like one of the young
gods,’ he cried. ‘I wonder if you really are one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Perhaps if we stay much longer we shall draw the
others down from heaven.’</p>

<p>‘Isn’t that what you would like? I expect you
still, deep down, have a kind of faith in them.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, how can I help having faith when one stands
living before my eyes? All hail, dear Dionysus! child
of fire and dew, and the creeping, delicate vine!...
Should we not offer up a sacrifice, Harold? I have
nothing here but these dry sea-flowers which I gathered
from the rock, but it is into the heart of the giver,
and not at the gift, that the gods look.... Let us
offer our slender garland to the presiding deity of the
place.’</p>

<p>He knelt down, and laid the few sea-pinks, and the
seaweed with which he had adorned his friend, on a
little shelf of rock. ‘That is the altar,’ he said
smiling, but more than half serious. Then he took
Brocklehurst’s hand and pulled him down to kneel
beside him while he prayed.</p>

<p>‘What god shall I give them to?’ he whispered.
‘You see they have so few worshippers left that they
may be a little jealous of one another. We do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
want the waves to rise up against us as they rose
against Hippolytus.’</p>

<p>‘Give them to the unknown God.’</p>

<p>‘Hush!—they will hear you: they must be drawing
very near.—O gods of Hellas! If anything in our lives
have found favour in your sight, accept this, our gift,
which, though it be poor, is given with our love; and
we beg that you will grant to each of us that thing which
may be best for him.... Harold, “need we anything
more? The prayer, I think, is enough for me.”’</p>

<p class="drop-cap">He could not quite say how it had
happened. It had come so suddenly,
so suddenly. And now, a few steps
behind the others, he was walking
toward the house. He had a feeling
of sickness, of horror: a helpless misery, the meaning
of which he shrank from realising, darkened his mind.
Only he remembered—he could not help remembering:
it was there before him with a curious vividness—the
light of the afternoon sun on the long white road; the
glare, the heat, something dark and motionless stretched
in the dust—still, very still....</p>

<p>Brocklehurst had been walking a few paces behind
him, and close to the hedge. He had been pulling
some wildflowers—a few had been scattered about
him as he lay there on the road, so strangely quiet
and white, a thin stream of red blood creeping through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
his hair and widening out, forming a little patch of
mud.... And when he had lifted him, the curious
whiteness of his face!</p>

<p>Yet in a way he had escaped wonderfully. None
of the wheels had touched him: just that single kick
a little above his left ear....</p>

<p>They had been walking slowly, Brocklehurst close
to the hedge, he, Graham, in the middle of the road,
when the terrified horses had come dashing round the
corner, the drag swaying violently behind them, one
of the reins hanging broken and useless. He remembered
jumping to one side. His foot had
slipped on something, and he had fallen. The dust,
the noise, a wheel just touching his coat as he rolled
himself out of the way.... He knew now that Brocklehurst
had sprung at the horses’ heads, had given him,
it might be, that one extra moment....</p>

<p>And now it was all over. Their long afternoon
in the boat; on the rocks; their little act of pagan
worship;—all that had been <em>this</em> afternoon, and it
was over. He was walking, a few steps behind the
others, up the avenue toward the house.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Night at last.</p>

<p>Every one at length gone away;
everything arranged; the house still
and solemn.</p>

<p>His father had left him alone for a little with the
dead boy. At last!...</p>

<p>His sorrow, which before the strangers he had
kept swallowed down, he need hide no longer. There
was no one to hear, no one to see. And he knelt
beside the bed and stroked the smooth cold cheek.
He kissed the cold mouth and stroked the soft
dark hair from which all stain had been washed;
and he put his arms about the body. And he remembered
the boy as he had stood before him that
afternoon in all his wonderful beauty. His tears fell
fast and blindingly. The sobs rising to his throat
almost choked him.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Day followed day. Brocklehurst had
been buried in the village churchyard;
his father and one of his brothers
(all of his family who had come over)
were returned home again; the blinds were drawn
up; the quiet flow of life, so harshly and unexpectedly
interrupted, had dropped back into its
accustomed channel; only for one boy a light had
gone out for ever from the sky; a glory and a beauty,
as he had known them once, had vanished from the
world.</p>

<p>All day long he tried to be alone, tried to avoid
his father; and whenever an opportunity presented
itself he would escape to his own room or to some
solitary place out of doors. It was almost as if he
were afraid of human companionship, afraid of the
sound of his own voice. And a curious unwillingness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
to mention Harold’s name, or to allude to him
in any way whatever, seemed to have taken possession
of him, though he spent daily a longer and longer
time at the boy’s grave, remaining there for hours,
until his father, who knew of these visits, grew
anxious for his health and wished to take him away
from home, offered to take him abroad—France,
Italy, Greece—anywhere he liked. But Graham
pleaded so desperately to be allowed to stay where
he was that Mr. Iddesleigh had not the heart to
refuse him—feared, indeed, that in his present state
of mind it might do him more harm than good.</p>

<p>Little wonder that the boy’s health began to give
way; that he looked so pale and tired! The holidays
were now almost over, but as yet nothing had been
said about his going back to school, though Graham
himself lived in secret dread of what he knew could
not be put off for much longer. How, on the other
hand, could he possibly resume the old life? The
thought of what had been and never would be again—oh!
that, he felt, he should not be able to bear—the
dreariness, the loneliness, the hopelessness. Doubtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
when he had first gone to school he had also
been alone—but the difference, the difference now
would be incalculable. There were days, in truth,
when it almost seemed to him that it would have
been better if he had never been given his happiness,
since so soon it was to be snatched from him; and
even though deep in his heart he knew he would not
forget it if he could, there were days when he thought
it would be well if all the past could be effaced
from his mind, rubbed out as figures are rubbed from a
child’s slate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One afternoon he was sitting with his father in the
library. It had been raining for the greater part of
the day, and a fine drizzle was still falling, though
the sky was beginning to clear. It had been raining,
and the soft sound of the rain—the soft, dripping
sound, and the sight of the blurred landscape, had
somehow a soothing effect upon him. On his knee
he held an open book over which his head was bent
closely. A lassitude, mental and physical, was visible
in his every little movement, even in the way he sat;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and between his eyes and the printed page he looked
at, there floated a dead boy’s face. A physical weakness
weighed heavily upon him, a kind of stagnation
of the very sources of his life, the vital elements,
sapping all power to rise above a certain fixed and
gloomy train of thought;—it was as if some spring
within him had been choked, dried up.... It was
finished!—finished!—finished! The word repeated
itself wearily in his mind, like the monotonous beating
of a metronome. He felt hot and feverish, and
there was a dull pain at the back of his head. It was
almost as if he were sickening for something....</p>

<p>Tired out, for his sleep of late was become very
restless and broken, presently he fell into a kind of
doze, from which he awakened, a few minutes later,
to find his father gazing anxiously at him; and with
sudden contrition he saw how selfish he had been in
giving way thus to his grief.</p>

<p>‘Are you very tired?’ Mr. Iddesleigh asked gently.
‘Come over here and sit by me.’ He drew his
son to him as he spoke, and Graham sat down on
a stool at his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>‘What were you doing all this morning? Were
you in the cemetery?’</p>

<p>Graham nodded.</p>

<p>Mr. Iddesleigh laid his hand on the boy’s head.
‘You go there so often!’ he expostulated. ‘It is not
good for you, Graham. What do you think about
when you go there all alone? What do you go there
for?’</p>

<p>Graham hesitated. He clasped his hands about his
knees, while he sat gazing out of the window. The
rain had ceased and a pale sun was beginning to peep
out between the heavy clouds. For some moments
he did not answer his father. The familiarity of
everything about him was borne into his mind. How
often he and his father had sat just as they were
sitting now!—in this same room! It seemed to him
that his life had been moving in a circle, and that he
was beginning to return on a path he already knew.
For a little the wings of some great spirit had drooped
softly about his head.... ‘Too like the lightning....’
His eyes filled and he bent down to hide his face.</p>

<p>‘What is the matter?’ Mr. Iddesleigh asked, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
still without getting any reply. ‘Tell me, Graham,
are you thinking about Harold?’</p>

<p>‘Do you wonder I never speak of him?’</p>

<p>‘Is it too near?... But your silence makes you
brood over it all the more.’</p>

<p>‘I cannot help thinking of him,’ Graham whispered.
‘He gave me his life.’ He rose from his stool, and
walking to the window pressed his forehead against
the cold glass.</p>

<p>The rain was still dripping from the trees, and there
was a damp smell in the air; but the sky was clearing,
and the sun was growing stronger and stronger.
Presently, and without further word, the boy left
the room.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">For a while he lingered near the house,
restlessly, forlornly, but by and by he
went down to the rocks, where he
stood looking out over the sea.</p>

<p>Piled up on the horizon, like a vast range of purple-black
hills, heavy masses of cloud drifted, scarce
perceptibly, from east to west of the pale slate-blue
sky; and where these rugged heaps were broken the
heavens sank away in limitless wells of pure pale
light, each edged with a border of bright grass-green.
All the light of the day seemed gathered there—like
a reflection from a world beyond—and Graham, as he
stood at gaze before it, began to wonder if he should
ever come any nearer to it than he was just there and
then. In the <cite>Phaedo</cite> he had found many arguments
for the immortality of the soul, but more lately he
had realised, in his own life, the only one perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
that actually counted—and this no argument at all;
but merely a very simple human desire, a desire to
look again upon the face of his friend, the face of
him who was buried in the grave.</p>

<p>He stooped down and leaned over the slowly-heaving
water, watching it rise and sink back, and rise
again and sink—over the dark, cold water that seemed
nearly black against the rocks—lower still, and lower,
till his hair almost brushed the surface.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">‘O water whispering<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Still through the dark into mine ears,—<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As with mine eyes, is it not now with his?—<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Mine eyes that add to thy cold spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wan water, wandering water weltering,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">This hidden tide of tears.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Presently he went on a little farther, clambering
back over the rocks, and taking a rough path which
brought him eventually to the church. The place was
quite deserted, as it almost always was, and he pushed
open the gate. He walked over the soft grass till he
came to Brocklehurst’s grave, where he knelt down.
The murmur of the sea rose from below—monotonous,
very peaceful. Ah, were they not happiest who slept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
here with that dim music drawing them farther and
farther from the world? An infinite melancholy drew
its sombre wings about the boy’s forehead—a melancholy
not wholly sprung from his recent sorrow, but
a kind of broader pity for all the suffering bound up
with life:—pity, above all, for the young boy who lay
now under the heavy earth, yet who had once been so
bright and active upon it. He found it curiously hard
to think of him as dead, out of existence. Was he
not still, even in that dim shadowy world whither he
had passed, conscious, sentient? Could he not still
feel some faint emotion, some faint stirring of hushed
joy or sorrow? Was not his heart still beating softly
under the grass? He stretched himself upon the
grave, lying full length, motionless. Face to face
they lay, only a little earth between them; and far
below he seemed to hear a breath drawn almost
silently, to hear the slow, sad stream of a boy’s tears
falling, falling evermore. In the stillness he could
hear his own heart beat—beat with the life that was
flowing away from him in a wide, clear flame, the flame
of a lamp burning swiftly up into the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>The sun had set when he turned to go home. But
as he passed the church door he noticed that it stood
ajar, and went in. A bucket of water and a broom
were in the porch, left there evidently for some
purpose; but the church itself was empty.</p>

<p>He sat down for a while in one of the pews; then
he knelt, leaning his face between his hands. A
strong desire to pray had come over him. But pray
to whom? Was this then, at last, to be the hour of
the unknown God?... And a few words floated
into his mind, came to him again and again, like a
memory of some old tune, or line of poetry: ‘Little
children, love one another....’ It seemed as if some
one were stooping down over him, it seemed as if
some one had kissed him, kissed him softly, had laid a
gentle hand upon his head.</p>

<p>And a feeling of ineffable peace began to creep into
his heart. Could it possibly be, then, that he was
really nearer to the unseen world than others were?
Now, surely, in some inexplicable way he had been
drawn very very close—closer than ever before. He
had a sense that something was about to happen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and that it would be something great, momentous,
supreme. It was as if he were upon the eve of some
stupendous discovery; and he waited—waited till
the signal should be given him—some sign which,
unlike any others he had hitherto received, would
come, this time, he knew, from without.</p>

<p>A profound stillness had fallen upon the church,
like the closing in of heavy waters. The murmur
of the sea had stopped.</p>

<p>Then across the hush there came a low sigh—a
whisper as of the brushing together of innumerable
leaves—a whisper which grew deeper and deeper,
till at last it seemed the music of some wonderful
summer, and Graham raised his head. Surely the
light had grown marvellously clear and soft. A
scent of many flowers was in the air; a murmur of
a fountain.</p>

<p>And as he knelt, motionless, the walls of the church
sank away from before him, and there—standing there
in that radiance of perfect light—ah, there, at last,
was Harold!</p>

<p>He stood in his garden, and he was more beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
than Graham had ever yet beheld him ... he
stretched out his hands ... he smiled.... His
feet were pale on the dark rich grass with its powder
of crocuses. Above his head the branches of the
trees almost met, forming a delicate roof, a roof of
green leaves, a green trellis very finely woven, through
which the light, mingled with a falling music of little
feathered throats, floated down soft and cool. All
around him was that wonderful liquid light, and the
music of water, listless, plashing, as it dropped into
some dim, cool, green-lipped basin of stone. And
over everything there hung a calm so deep, and
pure, and holy, that all Graham’s sorrow seemed to
melt away before it into one impassioned sense of
gratitude, and love, and peace.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I am coming—I am coming,’ he sobbed, rising
to his feet, and taking a step forward, quickly, blindly.
For a moment he stood there, swaying with a curious
movement from side to side; then he gave a little
moan and fell forward heavily on his face.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">When he opened his eyes he was lying
in bed, in his own room. The light
was darkened: there was a faint
smell of drugs in the air: and a
figure was moving noiselessly about,
preparing something at a small table. He had been
ill, then!... but for how long?</p>

<p>He heard a slight noise as of the door being very
carefully opened, and he saw his father come into
the room, walking on tiptoe. Graham kept his eyes
closed that they might not know he had awakened.
Things were beginning to come back to him, and for
just a few minutes longer he wanted to keep that
cool darkness about him.</p>

<p>He felt a strange languor through all his body; he
felt too weak to do anything but lie there in the
softened light, and in the twilight of his soul. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
would be soon enough to awaken in a little—not
just yet—in a little....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And all that was thirty years ago. His father was
long dead. Every one was dead.</p>

<p>Dawn had crept into the room, grey and ghostly.
He shivered and looked round. His letter, unfinished,
lay there on the table. Everything seemed cold,
desolate, lifeless. He got up and stretched himself,
for he felt stiff and cramped. Scarce worth while,
now, to go to bed! He walked over to the window
and looked out into the breaking day. The world
seemed very old and cheerless. Was it the chill of
approaching age in his own blood, he wondered, that
made him find it so? He smiled a strange, dim little
smile. Best, then, to sit by the fire and doze!</p>

<p>He came back to the table, and leaning over it,
buried his face in his hands.</p>

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
